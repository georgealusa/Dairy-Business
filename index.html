        <p style="color: white;text-align: center;font-style: italic;font-size: 2em;">Dairy farming is a class of
            agriculture
            for long-term<br> production of milk,
            which is processed (either <br>on the farm or at a dairy plant, either of which<br>
            may be called a dairy) for eventual sale of a dairy product.</p>

            Centralized dairy farming as we understand it primarily developed
            around villages and cities, where residents were
            unable to have cows of their own due to a lack of grazing land. Near
            the town, farmers could make some extra money on the side by having
            additional animals and selling the milk in town. The dairy farmers would
            fill barrels with milk in the morning and bring it to market on a wagon.
            Until the late 19th century, the milking of the cow was done by hand.
            In the United States, several large dairy operations existed in some
            northeastern states and in the west, that involved as many as several hundred
            cows, but an individual milker could not be expected to milk more than a dozen
            cows a day. Smaller operations predominated.

        <p style="font-size: 1.5em;">
            For most herds, milking took place indoors twice a day,[3] in a barn with the cattle
            tied by the neck with ropes or held in place by stanchions. Feeding could occur
            simultaneously with milking in the barn, although most dairy cattle were pastured
            during the day between milkings. Such examples of this method of dairy farming are
            difficult to locate, but some are preserved as a historic site for a glimpse into
            the days gone by. One such instance that is open for this is at Point Reyes National Seashore.
            Dairy farming has been part of agriculture for thousands of years. Historically it has
            been one part of small, diverse farms. In the last century or so larger farms concentrating
            on dairy production emerged. Large scale dairy farming is only viable where either a large
            amount of milk is required for production of more durable dairy products such as cheese, butter,
            etc. or there is a substantial market of people with cash to buy milk,
            but no cows of their own. Dairy farms were the best way to meet demand.

            Although any mammal can produce milk, commercial dairy farms are typically one-species
            enterprises.<br> In developed countries, dairy farms typically consist of high producing dairy
            cows. <br>Other species used in commercial dairy farming include goats, sheep, and camels. Donkeys in Italy.
